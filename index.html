         Step 2: Prepare the Cake Batter
      </summary>
      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p>Start by preheating your oven to the recommended temperature. Then, in a mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder.</p>
          <p>In another bowl, mix the wet ingredients: eggs, milk, and melted butter. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and mix until you have a smooth cake batter.</p>
          <p>Grease and flour the cake pan before pouring the batter into it.</p>

         Step 3: Bake the Cake 
      </summary>   
      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p>Place the cake pan with the batter into the preheated oven. Bake the cake for the specified time, usually around 30-35 minutes.</p>
          <p>To check if the cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. Remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a while before transferring it to a cooling rack.</p>

        Step 4: Frost and Decorate
      </summary>   
      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p>Once the cake has completely cooled, it's time to frost and decorate it. Melt chocolate and butter together, then add powdered sugar to create a delicious frosting.</p>
          <p>Spread the frosting evenly over the cake's top and sides. You can also decorate it with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh berries.</p>
